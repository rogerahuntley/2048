# 2048
repo for my 2048 remake in the Godot engine

Source code for my game *2048*, made with the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/). Playable [here](https://rogerthat52.itch.io/2048).

## addons

you need two addons

just download these and put them in your addons folder

* [silentwolf](https://silentwolf.com/download)
* [stealdog-common](https://github.com/rogerahuntley/stealdog-common)

## setup

you'll need to rename `env-example.tres` to `env.tres` and put in a silentwolf api key for leaderboards
